# zippass_serial

## Description of the problem

The zippass_serial program allow the user to recover the forgotten password of a zip folder. 
The program do it using a brute force approach to solve the problem, the code is written in C programming language, and is based on the procedural programming paradigm.
To process the ZIP files, we use the [libzip](https://libzip.org/) library, a FOSS implementation of the ZIP format. 

## Description of the solution

### Design of the program

The zippass_serial program is written in C, it does not use parallel programming to enhanced it's performance.
The program is based on 3 subroutines and 1 data structure.

**main**: the main function is the entry point of the program, it launch the password cracker algorithm.

**find_password**: the find_password function is used to create every single combination of password posible, it solve the problem using a brute force approach. The function generates all possible passwords using the given alphabet and for every password, the program try the password using the check_password function, to know if the password is valid or not.

**check_password**: check_password function is used to check if a given password is valid for a given encrypted zip file, first the program open the zip file given by the path, then try to open the first file (index 0) stored inside the zip file, and if this procedure works, the program check if the very first data stored in the file is the "CI0117-23a" string, if it is, then the program return 1, else the program return 0.

The data structure used to solve the problem is **shared_data_t** a simple data strucutre that contains multiple data used by the different functions of the project:

- char* alphabet: it's the set of chars that can be used in the password.
- uint64_t password_lenght: it's the maximum length of the password.
- uint64_t size_alphabet: it's the size of the alphabet.
- char* actual_password: it's a variable used to store the password found by the program, once a new password found for another zip file, the current password stored is lost.

### Program input

To compile the code use the given Makefile and execute the following command:

```
make clean
make
```

Once the code compiled, you can execute the project using the following input format:

```
0123456789
5

tests/zip_05/f01.zip
tests/zip_05/f23.zip
tests/zip_05/f09.zip
```


### Program output

The output format used by the program is the following:

```
tests/zip_05/f01.zip 00112
tests/zip_05/f23.zip
tests/zip_05/f09.zip 9209
```

The first part of each line is the path to the zip file, and the second one is the password that was found.

### Program dependencies

To process the ZIP file we need to have installed the libzip:

```
$ sudo apt install libzip-dev
```
